					<div>
						<p>Experience the tranquility that will reemerge and the inner healing you will experience during your session of this gentle healing practice. When deeply relaxed, your body will recall its natural state and allow you to release the obstacles keeping you from feeling complete, wholly alive and be the unique gift that is you.</p>

						<p>To achieve these goals, I use a blend of traditional Usui Reiki, Pranic Healing and Shamanic energy practices.  It is what I call Reiki & Beyond.  I utilize the modalities jointly, as guided by Spirit.</p>

						<h3>REIKI</h3>
						<p>Developed by Mikao Usui In Japan in the early 1900's, Reiki (pronounced ray-key) means "universal life energy". The body has an energy field that is central to its health and proper functioning.  This energy travels through pathways that can become blocked or weakened.  Reiki is based on the fundamental principle that the body possesses the innate ability to heal itself.</p>
					
						<p>Reiki involves the simple, gentle placement of hands on or above particular parts of the body including organs, glands and joints in order to create a smooth flow of energy throughout the body and facilitate relaxation and healing.</p>
					
						<p>Reiki is a simple, natural, non-invasive and safe method of spiritual healing and has, in the past several years, become mainstream. This hands-on healing practice is frequently utilized for patients in hospitals around the world to facilitate healing in centers as prestigious as The Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						Reiki is:
						<ul>
							<li>a system of healing using spiritually guided life force energy.</li>
							<li>a philosophy and system for personal development.</li>
							<li>a tool that can help develop intuitive sensitivity and spiritual awareness.</li>
							<li>a powerful healing system that can be applied through touch or intent.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						A healing system that can:
						<ul>
							<li>Be used as a daily meditative & healing practice</li>
							<li>Reduce blood pressure</li>
							<li>Release anxiety</li>

							<li>Release trapped emotion from the body</li>
							<li>Balance the Chakra system</li>

							<li>Be infused into objects</li>
							<li>Clear negative energy from spaces and locations</li>
						</ul>
					</div> 
					</br>
					<div>
						<h3>PRANIC HEALING</h3>
						<p>Pranic healing is a simple yet powerful and effective system of no-touch energy healing. As with Reiki, Pranic healing works on the principle that the healing process is accelerated by increasing the life force on the physical body.</p>
					
						<p>Pranic healing is applied on the bio-electromagnetic field known as the aura, which surrounds and interpenetrates the physical body. This energy body absorbs life energy and distributes it throughout the physical body, to the muscles, organs, glands, etc. The reason Pranic healing works on the energy body is that physical ailments first appear as energetic disruptions in the aura before manifesting as problems in the physical body.</p>
					</div>
					</br>
					<div>
						<h3>SHAMANIC ENERGY</h3>

						<p>Shamanic energy works with imprints in your luminous energy field. Its underlying principle is that our emotional, genetic and karmic history organizes energy, often leaving dense or heavy imprints in our luminous field, which create emotional and physical dysfunction.</p>

						<p>Shamanic practices exist throughout the world in many different traditions. Shamanism is based, in part, on the ancient knowledge that life is energy and that much of what exists in the world is not actually visible to most people. Because we live in a physical world in which energies often take a physical form, most people are not aware of the energetic realm.</p>
						<p>Every session is different and is based upon what is needed at that moment in time. The process will vary but the goal is always to help you to relax and allow the energy to flow through you in a more optimal way to allow healing to begin. This healing may take place physically, emotionally or spiritually. A session can allow you to connect more fully with your soul’s purpose and path.</p>
					</div>
					</br>
					<div>
					<h3>ANIMAL REIKI</h3>

						<p>Sessions for Animal Reiki require at least one-hour, sometimes a bit longer. The sessions must be held in the animal’s own environment (their home, stall, pen, etc…) where they will feel most comfortable and relaxed.  The sessions should be private, between just the animal and myself when possible. Time to discuss the animal and their needs will take place before the session and a follow-up discussion afterward.</p>
					</div> 
					</br>
					<hr>
					</br>
					<div style="text-align: center;">
						<p>60 minute session = $70</p>
	
						<p>30 minute session = $40 </p>
	
						<p>For all out calls there is a travel charge of $25 per hour or less.  All animal sessions are out calls.</p>
